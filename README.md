# Graph Project
Programming Portfolio

- Visual C++ Windows Form Project Demonstrating Various Algorithms on a Graph
- Built in Microsoft Visual Studio
- Run the program by importing the project in Visual Studio and then building it
- Detailed Report in Huffman Coding Tree folder
- Algorithms (CS312) Project
